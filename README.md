# Genesis

Genesis is a voice assistant written in python and designed to function offline. Currently both her wake-word detector and text-to-speech engine are offline and I am working to bring her speech-to-text recognition offline too.

Genesis is designed to run on a Raspberry Pi, however, many of the features are also available on Windows, MacOS and Debian Linux.
